|Problem
|Reason
|Solutions

|Developers didnt use JavaScript that much.
|Its not very used in the degree, and we are more used to other languajes.
|Refresh our knowledge of JavaScript and adapt as fast as possible.

|Most of the developers never used Node, Express, BootStrap, and other technologies that we used.
|The only subject that uses some if this technologies is in ye same year but it starts 2 months after we did. 
|Developers must auto-learn this technologies and practise to be able to do the project.

|Developers couldn´t connect Solid Pod´s with Node + Express.
|Solid is quite new and there is not that much of documentation, and there are unsolved bugs, seems to be very hard or maybe impossible to connect this two technologies.
|We had to regret the decision of non using React, and integrate the React + Node template.

|Never used React.
|The developers have never used React.
|Developers should learn the syntax and development methodology that React uses, and practise it to use it in the project.

|The React template its too big.
|The developers had to adapt to the enormous template that was inserted to the project.
|Developers should learn how the template works and wich parts we need and which we dont.

|Never used Solid.
|Solid is a totally new for us, we dont have any experience with it and there is not so much documentation because its quite new.
|Developers should look for information on how to work with SOLID and how it works.

|No knowledge about LDFlex.
|No knowledge.
|Search for detailed information about how to use it and how to work with it. Search for examples to understand its use.

|Problems with Github
|The use of Github + GitKraken produced many errors in some developers that cost time to fix.
|Developers should exercise caution when making changes to the develop and master branches

|Teamwork
|Problems comunicating with some of the team members
|The developers will have to talk and coordinate better.

|No experience developing a project this big.
|No experience with many libraries and work tools that could be useful to us.
|Search for information about the tools necessary to develop the project and which could help us.
