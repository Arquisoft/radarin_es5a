.Decisions:
* We have decided to use react because what is explained in class by being focused on react will help us.
* Use of SOLID.
* Using GitKraken to help us do version control.
* Use of Git for version control and facilitate teamwork.
* Use of Visual Studio Code to work on our project.
* Use of unit tests to verify the operation of the application.
* Asccidoctor to develop the documentation.
* Using Microsoft Teamns to do team meetings.
* We have decided to make the documentation in English.

.Discarded alternatives:
* We decided not to make the documentation in Spanish, since English is a more internationalized language.

.Problemns:
* Decide which technology to use without knowing how each one works.
* We independently study these technologies, looking for information from different sources.
