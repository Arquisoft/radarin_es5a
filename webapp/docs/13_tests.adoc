.Aceptance Tests
For testing the application we have used Jest, a JavaScript testing framework that is compatible with React and focused on simplicity, and the library react-testing-library. We aimed to achieve at least 50% of code coverage. We managed to have 47% of code coverage, with tests checking that the components of our application work correctly.

However, due to what we think it is a bug, we can not include these tests in master, since the CI is not able to run them correctly. We have created a branch tests which includes the tests developed.

Tests and code coverage.
