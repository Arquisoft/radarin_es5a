== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]


The system must be a web application compatible with the SOLID project. The system will allow people to organise meetings with friends in the area.

The motivation for this project is to protect the user's data as it is the user who decides what information is shared, giving the user control of their privacy. This is achieved by the way SOLID works, using the minimum amount of information necessary.

SOLID proposes to have a clear separation between user data, which is stored in a unique POD for the user and the application. Ensuring the security and privacy of user data.




=== Business Context

[role="arc42help"]

The communication partnes in this sistem would be the users and the users's friends. In addition,we would have others services involved, so far we have the POD which managed the data of the users. (This could increased as the apps develops)

=== Technical Context

[role="arc42help"]

The implementation of the system should be done using one of the Node frameworks to facilitate the desing of the web page.

The procesing of the file should be done using probably RDF, a system tha SOLID is compatible with. 

SOLID's POD server will allow us to store and access the information of the users.

Other representations of the information would be discuss and updated futher in the implementation of the system.
