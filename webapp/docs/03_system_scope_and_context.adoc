== System Scope and Context


[role="arc42help"]


The system must be a web application compatible with the SOLID project. The system will allow people to organise meetings with friends in the area.

The motivation for this project is to protect the user's data as it is the user who decides what information is shared, giving the user control of their privacy. This is achieved by the way SOLID works, using the minimum amount of information necessary.

SOLID proposes to have a clear separation between user data, which is stored in a unique POD for the user and the application. Ensuring the security and privacy of user data.

.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
