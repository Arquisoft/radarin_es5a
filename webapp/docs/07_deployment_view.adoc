== Deployment View

[role="arc42help"]
****
There are two infastructure levels, one for every type of app, WebApp and Android App. For simplicity only one UML will be explained.

First the WebApp must be use on a web Browser. This will use the functionality of the RestApi, the WebServer and some of the libraries. Similaly the Android App will use the RestApi but it will not use the server becouse its already integrated on the app.

Both app uses the google maps API to display the map, and both uses the Solid Pods and firebase(Database) to store information.
