.Basic Uml of the App

This shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks and dependencies. Since we use the SOLID architecture, we make use of SOLID PODS.

* User: the user that uses the app
* PODS: storage for the user's information
* Radarin: whitch will be the communicator between the restApi and the user
* RestApi: an api to glue all the components
* Firebase: the database 

*Level 1* Usage between all parts of the project

*Level 2* An in deph view of the communication in the app

*Level 3* The libraries of the restApi; the core of the app.

Level 3::
Rigth now we use a solid library capable of comunicate with the solid pods, on the WebApp ,not on the restApi, but the principal idea is to be capable of using some kind of library like the two displayed bellow.
