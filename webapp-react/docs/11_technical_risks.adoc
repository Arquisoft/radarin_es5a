|Priority|Risk|Analysis|Suggested Solution
|1|Struggling with technology|The technology used in this project is new for the developers, this can lead to some troubles or delays.|Independent study of the technologies.
|2|Change of tools|We had to decide which tools we are using for the project, without much knowledge about them or the alternatives.|Being aware of the posibilities of the current tools and the alternative ones, so if we end up deciding to change them or forced to do it for fulfilling our needs, we could reconstruct the project as soon as possible.
|3|Coordination issues|The team is formed by 7 students, in other words, 7 people with different working hours. This is also the larger team for a project of the degree until now (groups were usually up to 4 people).|Establishment of good communication channels. Mobile messaging for general information and more visibility for some aspects; github for specific and technical information.
